            <img src="images/profile.webp" alt="Profile picture of author" width="150">
            <p>My full name is Nephi Odin Jayce Brown, although I usually just go by Nephi. I was born in Saudi Arabia and grew up in South Africa until I was 13. After that we moved to the UK, where my family has been ever since. I am currently studying Engineering at York University, and am trying my best to have a good first year.</p>

            <p>The United Kingdom is actually a union of four countries. These countries are: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The UK has a number of iconic landmarks such as Big Ben, the Tower of London, and Stonehenge. It is also well known for still having a royal family, although they play little roll in the countries actual politics.</p>
